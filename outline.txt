Project Outline:

** Scrape github readme to predict programming language used for repos **


ACQUIRE:
Scrape at least 100 repos for dataset
    - create python code to do this
    - look at top 10 languages (?)

get the body text and create a model (classification) to predict 
** (Finish today)


EXPLORE:
What are the most frequent words used in README's?
What does the distribution of IDFs look like for the most common words?
Does the length of the README vary by programming language?
Do different programming languages use a different number of unique words?


MODEL:
Classification models
**(finish tomorrow)
